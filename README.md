SpeedTest by OpenSpeedTest™ is a Free and Open-Source HTML5 Network Performance Estimation Tool Written in Vanilla Javascript and only uses built-in Web APIs like `XMLHttpRequest` `(XHR)`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`, & `SVG`. No Third-Party frameworks or libraries are Required. All we need is a static web server like `NGINX`. I started this project in 2011 and moved to OpenSpeedTest.com dedicated Project/Domain Name in 2013.
